Here is how I defined my tables for my egornomic workspace database:

    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS categories (
        category_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
        category_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        )
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items (
        item_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
        category_id UUID NOT NULL,
        item_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        item_description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        item_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories (category_id)
        )
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS workspaces (
        workspace_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
        workspace_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        workspace_description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        workspace_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
        workspace_image VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        )
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS workspace_items (
        workspace_item_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
        workspace_id UUID NOT NULL,
        item_id UUID NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (workspace_id) REFERENCES workspaces (workspace_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (item_id) REFERENCES items (item_id)
        )

I have added entries for the categores table as follows:

category_id category_name
204947a2-23f0-48c5-b4ab-315bbf7ed40a Chair
b324415e-070a-4ee7-b231-106769a21848 Desk
8f40b428-d499-4e26-a481-b1ec1589592b Monitor & Display
c336a0d4-895a-493d-b05d-3c7e7f4c4fe6 Keyboard & Mouse
faefab1b-f0ab-4946-81fd-5d662b6dc1e8 Lighting
11994bc2-929a-4404-99d0-caab29e640a3 Pet
6670fd01-fdf5-4b04-8f13-2b1f2493a663 Plants & Scenery
610a584e-7e51-4b81-82de-a70c45dcabdc Personal Comfort
a58e0e8a-e3ef-4eef-8bfa-2685a377f2f8 Accessories

All these categories represent different categories of items that the user can choose to create a custom ergonomic workspace.

Now, I need to fill in the data for items table. Generate a query that will insert the data for the items table. Each category should have at least 10 items. The item_id should be generated automatically using the uuid_generate_v4() function. The category_id should be selected from the categories table. The item_name should be a string of 10 characters. The item_description should be a string of 20 characters. The item_price should be the price of the item. The items should be actual ergonomic items that the user can find online and purchase.

ased on your table structure, you could create mock data for the items table using SQL INSERT statements. Here are some examples with at least 10 items for each category:

-- Chairs

Great.
Now, I can you generate a query that I can use to get categories and their items? I want to get the results from the database in this form:

[
{
category_name: "Category 1",
items: [
{
item_name: "Item 1",
item_description: "Description of item 1",
item_price: "$10.00",
item_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
},
{
item_name: "Item 1",
item_description: "Description of item 1",
item_price: "$10.00",
item_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
},
item_name: "Item 1",
item_description: "Description of item 1",
item_price: "$10.00",
item_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
]
},
{
category_name: "Category 2",
items: [
{
item_name: "Item 1",
item_description: "Description of item 1",
item_price: "$10.00",
item_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
},
{
item_name: "Item 1",
item_description: "Description of item 1",
item_price: "$10.00",
item_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
},
item_name: "Item 1",
item_description: "Description of item 1",
item_price: "$10.00",
item_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
]
}
]

I can use the following query to get the results in the above format:

SELECT
categories.category_name,
json_agg(
json_build_object(
'item_name', items.item_name,
'item_description', items.item_description,
'item_price', items.item_price,
'item_image', items.item_image
)
) AS items
FROM categories
INNER JOIN items ON categories.category_id = items.category_id
GROUP BY categories.category_name

delete all items

DELETE FROM items;
